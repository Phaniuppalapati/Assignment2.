    "Q1. In Python, a string is a type of data that represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks, either single (\") or double (\"'\"'). Strings are used to store and manipulate textual data. For example:\n",
    "name = \"John Doe\"\n",
    "In the above code, \"John Doe\" is a string assigned to the variable `name`. Strings can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.\n",
    "In Python, variables are created by assigning a value to them using the assignment operator (=). For example:\n",

    "1. Integer (int):\n",
    "An integer is a whole number without any decimal points. It can be positive, negative, or zero. For example: `0`, `-5`, `10. Integers are used for representing numerical values in various calculations and operations.\n",
    "2. String (str):A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (\") or double quotes (\"\"). It represents textual data and allows you to store and manipulate sequences of letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. For example:\n",

    "3. List:A list is an ordered collection of elements enclosed in square brackets ([]). It can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, or even other lists. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified. For example: [1, 2, 3]`, `['apple', 'banana', 'orange']. Lists are commonly used for storing and organizing multiple items, and they provide various methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.\n",

    "In Python, an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. It can be as simple as a single variable or value, or it can be more complex, involving multiple components and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Literals: These are fixed values such as numbers (e.g., 42, 3.14) or strings (e.g., \"Hello, world!\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Variables: These are names that represent values stored in memory. You can use variables in expressions to perform operations or retrieve values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Operators: These are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more values. For example, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) perform mathematical calculations, and comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) compare values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calls: These are invocations of predefined functions or user-defined functions. Functions can take arguments and return values, and you can use them within expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions in Python are used to compute values and perform operations. They can be used in assignments to assign values to variables, in conditional statements to control program flow, as arguments to functions, or as part of more complex expressions\n",
    "Q 5\n",
    "An expression is a piece of code that produces a value when it is executed. It can be a combination of variables, literals, operators, and function calls. Examples of expressions include:\n",

    "2 + 3 (evaluates to the value 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "x ^ * y* (evaluates the product of variables x and y)\n",

    "len (^ prime prime heII o^ prime prime ) (evaluates to the length of the string \"hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a statement is a complete unit of code that performs an action. It usually consists of one or more expressions and can include control flow structures such as conditionals and loops. Statements do not produce a value. Examples of statements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment statement: `spam = 10 (assigns the value 10 to the variable `spam`)\n",

    "After running the given code, the variable `bacon` would contain the value 22.

    "Q 8\n",
    "In most programming languages, including popular ones like Python, eggs is a valid variable name because it follows the naming rules and conventions for variables. However, 100 is considered an invalid variable name in most programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some general rules for naming variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variables must start with a letter a - Z A-Z) or an underscore (_) character.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After the first character, variables can include letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "3. Variable names are case-sensitive, so \"Eggs\" and \"eggs\" would be considered different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Variables should not be named after reserved keywords or built-in functions of the programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these rules, eggs meets the requirements for a valid variable name because it starts with a letter and contains only letters. On the other hand, 100 starts with a number, which violates the rule that variables must start with a letter or an underscore. However, it's worth noting that some programming languages have different naming conventions or allow\n",
    "certain symbols in variable names, so the rules can vary depending on the language being used.\n",
